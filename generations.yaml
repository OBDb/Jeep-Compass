    description: "The original Jeep Compass was introduced alongside the Patriot as Jeep's entry into the growing compact crossover segment. Built on the GS platform shared with the Dodge Caliber, it featured more road-focused, car-like characteristics than traditional Jeep models. The exterior styling attempted to blend Jeep design cues like the seven-slot grille with a more contemporary crossover shape. Powertrain options centered around a 2.0L or 2.4L four-cylinder engine, paired with either a manual transmission, conventional automatic, or continuously variable transmission (CVT). Front-wheel drive was standard with an available Freedom Drive I all-wheel drive system. The interior was initially criticized for hard plastics and basic design, though a significant refresh in 2011 improved materials, styling, and feature content considerably. This update also brought exterior styling more in line with the Grand Cherokee, including a more traditional Jeep grille design. While the first-generation Compass offered reasonable value and fuel economy, its limited off-road capability and refinement positioned it as an entry-level option that sacrificed some of Jeep's traditional strengths in favor of affordability and on-road comfort."

  - name: "Second Generation (MP/552)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2027
    description: "The second-generation Compass debuted in September 2016 in Brazil and at the Los Angeles Auto Show, representing a complete redesign that dramatically improved the model's positioning and capability. Built on the Small Wide LWB platform shared with the Renegade, it features sophisticated styling inspired by the Grand Cherokee, with a sleeker profile and premium design elements. Powertrain options include a 2.4L Tigershark four-cylinder engine in North America paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission, with various gasoline and diesel engines available internationally. Available in front-wheel drive or with Jeep's Selec-Terrain four-wheel drive system, including the advanced Active Drive Low with a 20:1 crawl ratio on Trailhawk models. The interior offers significantly improved design, materials, and technology, featuring Uconnect infotainment systems with 7-inch or 8.4-inch touchscreens and modern safety features. A substantial refresh for 2022 updated the exterior styling, completely redesigned the interior with a more horizontal dashboard layout and larger screens, and added new technology features including a digital instrument cluster option. This generation successfully repositioned the Compass as a more premium compact SUV, bridging the gap between the smaller Renegade and larger Cherokee while offering genuine off-road capability in Trailhawk form—earning Jeep's 'Trail Rated' designation. A plug-in hybrid 4xe variant was also introduced, combining a 1.3L turbocharged engine with an electric motor for enhanced efficiency."

    description: "The third-generation Compass was unveiled in May 2025, representing Jeep's most advanced and versatile iteration of the compact SUV. Built on Stellantis's STLA Medium platform, it is the first Jeep offered with the choice of mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric powertrains, ensuring it can meet diverse customer needs. The design retains Jeep's signature seven-slot grille and trapezoidal wheel arches while introducing X-shaped LED taillights, illuminated Jeep logo, and a chrome-free exterior for ecological reasons. The interior features a 10-inch digital instrument cluster and a 16-inch touchscreen infotainment system, with most controls being touchscreen-based. Standard approach, breakover, and departure angles are 20, 15, and 26 degrees respectively, with a ground clearance of approximately 8 inches and maximum wading depth enhanced for off-road capability. Level 2 autonomous driving assistance is available. Production for North American models will begin at Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois starting in late 2026 or early 2027 for the 2028 model year, while European production continues at the Melfi plant in Italy."
