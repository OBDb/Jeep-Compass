    description: "The original Jeep Compass was introduced alongside the Patriot as Jeep's entry into the growing compact crossover segment. Built on the GS platform shared with the Dodge Caliber, it featured more road-focused, car-like characteristics than traditional Jeep models. The exterior styling attempted to blend Jeep design cues like the seven-slot grille with a more contemporary crossover shape. Powertrain options centered around a 2.0L or 2.4L four-cylinder engine, paired with either a manual transmission, conventional automatic, or continuously variable transmission (CVT). Front-wheel drive was standard with an available Freedom Drive I all-wheel drive system. The interior was initially criticized for hard plastics and basic design, though a significant refresh in 2011 improved materials, styling, and feature content considerably. This update also brought exterior styling more in line with the Grand Cherokee, including a more traditional Jeep grille design. While the first-generation Compass offered reasonable value and fuel economy, its limited off-road capability and refinement positioned it as an entry-level option that sacrificed some of Jeep's traditional strengths in favor of affordability and on-road comfort."

    description: "The current Compass represents a complete redesign that dramatically improved the model's positioning and capability. Built on the Small Wide platform shared with the Renegade and various Fiat products, it features more sophisticated styling inspired by the Grand Cherokee, with a sleeker profile and premium design elements. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include a 2.4L four-cylinder in North America and a range of gasoline and diesel engines internationally, paired with manual, automatic, or nine-speed automatic transmissions depending on configuration. Available in front-wheel drive or with various four-wheel drive systems, including the advanced Active Drive Low with a 20:1 crawl ratio on Trailhawk models. The interior offers significantly improved design, materials, and technology, featuring Uconnect infotainment systems with either 7-inch or 8.4-inch touchscreens and modern safety features. A substantial refresh for 2022 updated the exterior styling, completely redesigned the interior with a more horizontal dashboard layout and larger screens, and added new technology features including a digital instrument cluster option. This generation successfully repositioned the Compass as a more premium compact SUV, bridging the gap between the smaller Renegade and larger Cherokee while offering genuine off-road capability in Trailhawk formâ€”earning Jeep's 'Trail Rated' designation that the first generation never achieved."
